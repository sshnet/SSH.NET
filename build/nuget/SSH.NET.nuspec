        <releaseNotes>2016.0.0-beta2
==============

Changes:

    * Improved performance of ScpClient (GitHub issue #21)

Fixes:

    * Terminal width (pixels) is not passed in pty-req
    * Stopping ForwardedPortDynamic without ever having started would result in a NRE

2016.0.0-beta1
==============

New Features:

    * Added support for HMAC-SHA512 (hmac-sha2-512 and hmac-sha2-512-96)
    * Added support for Universal Windows Platform 10 (UAP10.0)

Changes:

    * Overall performance improvements
    * Relicensed code under MIT license, explicitly permitting reuse within proprietary software
      provided all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the
      copyright notice
    * Separated our hash algorithms into SshNet.Security.Cryptography project and package
    * When available, prefer hash algorithms and encodings from target framework
    * Refactoring to prepare for upcoming .NET Core support

Fixes:

    * Partial reads from stream assume end (CodePlex issue #1516)
    * Session.Disconnect() hangs forever (CodePlex issue #2591)
    * SshData.ReadInt64() is broken (CodePlex issue #2579)
    * Race condition when SSH_MSG_GLOBAL_REQUEST is received immediately after successful authentication (GitHub issue #8)

2014.4.6-beta2
==============

New Features:

    * Improved accuracy of IsConnected on .NET
    * Added support for ssh.com (SSH-2) private keys (issue #1987)
    * Support an acceptable group of up to 8192 bits for SHA-1 and SHA-256 Diffie-Hellman Group and Key Exchange (issues #1973 and #1777)

Changes:

    * Reduced default buffer size for SftpClient from 64 KB to 32 KB as some SSH servers apply a hard limit of 64 KB at the transport level.

Fixes:

    * SftpClient is throwing undocumented exceptions (issue #2148)
    * Client channels are no longer closed on dispose (issue #1943)
    * SftpClient.Exists(string) returns true for a path that does not exist (issues #1952, #1696 and #1574)
    * ObjectDisposedException when channel is closing (issues #1942 and #1944)
    * Stack overflow during authentication when server returns same allowed methods after partial success (issue #2399)
    * SshCommand doesn't cleanup subscribed events (issue #2295)
    * Lines before protocol identification string are not skipped (issue #1935 and #2223)
    * ShellStream.ReadLine produces incorrect output when reading multi-byte characters (issue #2190)
    * SftpClient constructor throws ArgumentException when host contains underscore (issue #1845)
    * Signing key is missing from source download (issue #2455)
    * Forwarded Port channels can get stuck waiting (issue #1558)
    * NullReferenceException when SftpFileStream is finalized after dispose of session (issue #2013)
    * BlockCipher.Encrypt fails if input message is not padded (issue #2547)
    * ScpClient: Missing files when using DirectoryUpload (issue #1382)
    * Dynamic port forwarding slows down to a crawl (issue #2010)
    * SendKeepAlive causes SocketException when connection is dropped (issue #2029)
    * SocketException on Dispose or Disconnect (issue #2400)
    * Sending EOF on wrong channel number (issue #1877)
    * ForwardedPortDynamic: Unhandled exception if client terminates socket (issue #1844)

2014.4.6-beta1
==============

New Features:

    * Added callbacks to UploadFile, DownloadFile and ListDirectory in SftpClient (issue #1324)
    * Allow a given private key file to be used concurrently
    * Performance improvements:
        - optimization of payload size for both read and write operations (SftpClient only)
        - increase window size from 1MB to 2MB
        - increase buffer size from 16KB to 64KB for SftpClient
        - take into account the maximum remote packet size of the channel for write operations
        - increase maximum size of packets that we can receive from 32 KB to 64 KB
    * Improve exception message for authentication failures

Breaking changes:

    * Assembly name is now Renci.SshNet for all supported frameworks
    * The Renci.SshNet assemblies for .NET and Silverlight are now strong-named (issue #1802)

Fixes:

    * Incorrect copyright in assemblies (issue #1764)
    * Remove linefeed from WriteLine method in Shellstream class (issue #1584)
    * Disable logging of messages in release builds (issue #1767)
    * Stuck loop on key exchange using arcfour encryption (issue #1922)
    * Timeout sending data to server with low window size (issue #1706)
    * No connection possible with the same auth method requested multiple times (issue #1930)
    * Unobserved exception rethrown by finalizer thread (issue #1298 and #1587)
    * Client cipher is used to decrypt server messages (issue #1917)
    * Connection dropped by server due to invalid DSA signature (issue #1918)
    * Correct casing of Security/Cryptography/HMAC.cs to fix build on Linux (issue #1505)
    * HTTP proxy hangs (issue #1890)
    * Wrong parameters to SetSocketOption leads to SocketException under Mono (issue #1799)
    * Incorrect check for timeout values (issue #1620)
    * Wrong PKCS7 padding in DES algorithm (issue #1580)
    * OverflowException on empty server response (issue #1562)
    * Event handle leak (issue #1761)
    * SftpFileStream is very slow (issue #1919)
    * Write access required for private key file</releaseNotes>
