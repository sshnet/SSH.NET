# Foreword

There is MSDN-style class documentation in a .chm file for each release, which you can find in the Assets section
of the [latest release](https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET/releases/latest) page.  Please note that you will need
to [right-click and "unblock"](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2021383/some-chm-files-may-not-render-properly-on-windows-vista-and-windows-7)
the CHM file after you download it.

Currently (4/18/2020), the documentation is very sparse.  Fortunately, there are a large number of tests in
[Renci.SshNet.Tests](https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET/tree/develop/test/Renci.SshNet.Tests) that demonstrate
usage with working code.

If the test for the functionality you would like to see documented is not complete, then you are cordially
invited to read the source, Luke, and highly encouraged to generate a pull request for the implementation of
the missing test once you figure things out.  🤓
